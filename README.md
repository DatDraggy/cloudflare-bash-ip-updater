# Cloudflare IP Updater in Bash
This small script updates your IPv4 and IPv6 records in your cloudflare account.

Before using this, create an A and and AAAA record with the same name as the one you put in `record_name`.

If you have a dynamic ip address, you can make cronjob execute this file every ~5 minutes.
It then checks if the current address is the same as the one in cloudflare and updates them if they are not the same.

If you have multiple domains pointing to the same server, you can simply set a "CNAME" record to the domain in `record_name`.
